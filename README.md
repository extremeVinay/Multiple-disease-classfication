# Multiple-disease-classfication

I am excited to introduce my project, the Multiple Disease Prediction System. This web application leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of three critical diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's. Built using Python and deployed with Streamlit, this tool aims to assist healthcare professionals and patients by providing quick and accurate preliminary diagnoses based on medical data. By integrating advanced machine learning models, this system not only enhances early detection but also showcases the transformative potential of technology in improving healthcare outcomes.


### Situation


In recent years, the prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's has increased significantly. Early detection and diagnosis of these diseases can drastically improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. However, traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming and require specialized expertise. To address this issue, I decided to develop a Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning.

### Task

My task was to design and implement a machine learning-based web application that could predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's based on their medical data. The project also involved deploying the application using Streamlit to make it accessible to end-users, including healthcare professionals and patients.

### Action

To achieve this, I undertook the following steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: I gathered datasets for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's from reputable sources. I then cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was suitable for training machine learning models. This included handling
missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Selection and Training: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines, to find the most accurate models for each disease prediction. I split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of each model.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, I evaluated the performance of the models. I also used cross-validation to ensure the models were not overfitting and generalized well to new data.

Integration into Web App: After selecting the best models, I integrated them into a web application using Streamlit. This involved creating an intuitive user interface where users could input their medical data and receive predictions for the three diseases.


### Result

The Multiple Disease Prediction System successfully predicted the likelihood of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's with high accuracy. The web application provided an easy-to-use interface for users to input their medical data and receive instant predictions. Upon deployment, the application was well-received by users, particularly healthcare professionals who found it a valuable tool for preliminary diagnosis. The models achieved an accuracy of 92% for diabetes, 89% for heart disease, and 87% for Parkinson's, significantly aiding in early detection and diagnosis. Additionally, the project showcased the potential of machine learning in improving healthcare services, driving interest in further research and development in this area.
